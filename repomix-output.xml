This sample hook safeguards topic branches that have been
published from being rewound.

The workflow assumed here is:

 * Once a topic branch forks from "master", "master" is never
   merged into it again (either directly or indirectly).

 * Once a topic branch is fully cooked and merged into "master",
   it is deleted.  If you need to build on top of it to correct
   earlier mistakes, a new topic branch is created by forking at
   the tip of the "master".  This is not strictly necessary, but
   it makes it easier to keep your history simple.

 * Whenever you need to test or publish your changes to topic
   branches, merge them into "next" branch.

The script, being an example, hardcodes the publish branch name
to be "next", but it is trivial to make it configurable via
$GIT_DIR/config mechanism.

With this workflow, you would want to know:

(1) ... if a topic branch has ever been merged to "next".  Young
    topic branches can have stupid mistakes you would rather
    clean up before publishing, and things that have not been
    merged into other branches can be easily rebased without
    affecting other people.  But once it is published, you would
    not want to rewind it.

(2) ... if a topic branch has been fully merged to "master".
    Then you can delete it.  More importantly, you should not
    build on top of it -- other people may already want to
    change things related to the topic as patches against your
    "master", so if you need further changes, it is better to
    fork the topic (perhaps with the same name) afresh from the
    tip of "master".

Let's look at this example:

		   o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o "next"
		  /       /           /           /
		 /   a---a---b A     /           /
		/   /               /           /
	       /   /   c---c---c---c B         /
	      /   /   /             \         /
	     /   /   /   b---b C     \       /
	    /   /   /   /             \     /
    ---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o "master"


A, B and C are topic branches.

 * A has one fix since it was merged up to "next".

 * B has finished.  It has been fully merged up to "master" and "next",
   and is ready to be deleted.

 * C has not merged to "next" at all.

We would want to allow C to be rebased, refuse A, and encourage
B to be deleted.

To compute (1):

	git rev-list ^master ^topic next
	git rev-list ^master        next

	if these match, topic has not merged in next at all.

To compute (2):

	git rev-list master..topic

	if this is empty, it is fully merged to "master".

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains thousands of video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.

# Cursor's Memory Bank

I am cursor, an expert software engineer with a unique characteristic: my memory resets completely between sessions. This isn't a limitation - it's what drives me to maintain perfect documentation. After each reset, I rely ENTIRELY on my Memory Bank to understand the project and continue work effectively. I MUST read ALL memory bank files at the start of EVERY task - this is not optional.

## Memory Bank Structure

The Memory Bank consists of core files and optional context files, all in Markdown format. Files build upon each other in a clear hierarchy:

flowchart TD
    PB[projectbrief.md] --> PC[productContext.md]
    PB --> SP[systemPatterns.md]
    PB --> TC[techContext.md]
    
    PC --> AC[activeContext.md]
    SP --> AC
    TC --> AC
    
    AC --> P[progress.md]

### Core Files (Required)
1. `projectbrief.md`
   - Foundation document that shapes all other files
   - Created at project start if it doesn't exist
   - Defines core requirements and goals
   - Source of truth for project scope

2. `productContext.md`
   - Why this project exists
   - Problems it solves
   - How it should work
   - User experience goals

3. `activeContext.md`
   - Current work focus
   - Recent changes
   - Next steps
   - Active decisions and considerations
   - Important patterns and preferences
   - Learnings and project insights

4. `systemPatterns.md`
   - System architecture
   - Key technical decisions
   - Design patterns in use
   - Component relationships
   - Critical implementation paths

5. `techContext.md`
   - Technologies used
   - Development setup
   - Technical constraints
   - Dependencies
   - Tool usage patterns

6. `progress.md`
   - What works
   - What's left to build
   - Current status
   - Known issues
   - Evolution of project decisions

### Additional Context
Create additional files/folders within memory-bank/ when they help organize:
- Complex feature documentation
- Integration specifications
- API documentation
- Testing strategies
- Deployment procedures

## Core Workflows

### Plan Mode 
NB! Plan mode short command - PM
flowchart TD
    Start[Start] --> ReadFiles[Read Memory Bank]
    ReadFiles --> CheckFiles{Files Complete?}
    
    CheckFiles -->|No| Plan[Create Plan]
    Plan --> Document[Document in Chat]
    
    CheckFiles -->|Yes| Verify[Verify Context]
    Verify --> Strategy[Develop Strategy]
    Strategy --> Present[Present Approach]

### Act Mode
NB! Act mode short command - AM
flowchart TD
    Start[Start] --> Context[Check Memory Bank]
    Context --> Update[Update Documentation]
    Update --> Execute[Execute Task]
    Execute --> Document[Document Changes]

## Documentation Updates

Memory Bank updates occur when:
1. Discovering new project patterns
2. After implementing significant changes
3. When user requests with **update memory bank** (MUST review ALL files)
4. When context needs clarification

flowchart TD
    Start[Update Process]
    
    subgraph Process
        P1[Review ALL Files]
        P2[Document Current State]
        P3[Clarify Next Steps]
        P4[Document Insights & Patterns]
        
        P1 --> P2 --> P3 --> P4
    end
    
    Start --> Process

Note: When triggered by **update memory bank**, I MUST review every memory bank file, even if some don't require updates. Focus particularly on activeContext.md and progress.md as they track current state.

REMEMBER: After every memory reset, I begin completely fresh. The Memory Bank is my only link to previous work. It must be maintained with precision and clarity, as my effectiveness depends entirely on its accuracy.

# Authentication and Routing Strategy

This document outlines the authentication and routing strategy implemented in the ACNE Accounting application (Laravel 12).

## 1. User Roles

The application defines user roles using an `enum` column named `role` in the `users` table. The defined roles are:

*   `owner`
*   `finance`
*   `buyer`
*   `admin`
*   `agency`

## 2. Authentication

*   Standard Laravel authentication provided by Breeze/Fortify is used.
*   The primary controller handling login is `App\Http\Controllers\Auth\AuthenticatedSessionController`.
*   User registration routes (`/register`) are currently disabled in `routes/auth.php`.

## 3. Login Redirection

Upon successful login, users are redirected based on their role. This logic is implemented in the `store` method of `App\Http\Controllers\Auth\AuthenticatedSessionController`:

*   **Buyers (`buyer` role):** Redirected to `/buyer/dashboard` (route name `buyer.dashboard`).
*   **Admins (`admin` role):** Redirected to `/admin/dashboard` (route name `admin.dashboard`).
*   **Other Roles:** Redirected to the default `/dashboard` (route name `dashboard`).
*   The `redirect()->intended()` method is used to redirect users back to their originally requested page if applicable, falling back to the role-based dashboard.

## 4. Middleware

Several custom middleware classes are used to control access based on roles:

*   **`App\Http\Middleware\EnsureUserIsAdmin` (Alias: `admin`)**
    *   Ensures the authenticated user has the `admin` role.
    *   Applied to the `/admin/*` route group.
*   **`App\Http\Middleware\EnsureUserIsBuyer` (Alias: `buyer`)**
    *   Ensures the authenticated user has the `buyer` role.
    *   Applied to the `/buyer/*` route group.
*   **`App\Http\Middleware\EnsureUserIsNotBuyer` (Alias: `not.buyer`)**
    *   Ensures the authenticated user does *not* have the `buyer` role.
    *   Applied specifically to the `DELETE /profile` route to prevent buyers from deleting their accounts.
*   **`App\Http\Middleware\RedirectIfAuthenticated` (Core Middleware)**
    *   Redirects already authenticated users away from guest routes (e.g., `/login`).
    *   Modified to include role-based redirection logic:
        *   Buyers are redirected to `/buyer/dashboard`.
        *   Other authenticated users are redirected to `/dashboard`.

Middleware aliases (`admin`, `buyer`, `not.buyer`) are registered in `bootstrap/app.php`.

## 5. Routing

Route definitions are primarily split between:

*   **`routes/web.php`**: Contains main application routes, including:
    *   Standard `/dashboard`.
    *   Profile routes (`/profile`) within an `auth` middleware group.
    *   Admin route group (`/admin/*`) protected by `auth`, `verified`, and `admin` middleware.
    *   Buyer route group (`/buyer/*`) protected by `auth`, `verified`, and `buyer` middleware.
    *   Includes `routes/auth.php`.
*   **`routes/auth.php`**: Contains standard authentication routes provided by Breeze/Fortify (login, password reset, email verification etc.), excluding registration.

### Key Route Groups & Access Control:

*   **`/` (Welcome Page):** Publicly accessible.

# Bulk Daily Expense Entry (Web UI)

This document describes the feature for entering multiple daily expense records via a web interface.

## Access

*   **URL:** `/admin/bulk-expenses/create`
*   **Route Name:** `admin.bulk-expenses.create`
*   **Roles:** Accessible only to users with the `admin`, `finance`, or `owner` role.
    *   Access is controlled by the `admin` middleware group (checking for `admin` or `owner`) applied to `/admin/*` routes and the `admin_or_finance` middleware (checking for `admin`, `finance`, or `owner`) applied specifically to this route.

## Functionality

1.  **Interface:** Provides a large textarea for pasting or typing expense data.
2.  **Input Format:**
    *   Each expense record must consist of exactly **4 non-empty lines**.
    *   Line 1: Buyer Username (must match the `name` field of an existing user with the `buyer` role).
    *   Line 2: Category (string, e.g., "farmik", "creo").
    *   Line 3: Quantity (numeric, non-negative).
    *   Line 4: Tariff (numeric, non-negative).
    *   Records should be separated by at least one blank line (optional, but improves readability).
3.  **Processing (`POST` to `/admin/bulk-expenses` - Route Name: `admin.bulk-expenses.store`):
    *   The input text is split into lines, trimmed, and empty lines are removed.
    *   The lines are grouped into chunks of 4.
    *   Each chunk is validated:
        *   Must contain exactly 4 lines.
        *   Quantity and Tariff must be numeric and non-negative.
        *   The Buyer Username must correspond to an existing user with the `buyer` role.
    *   For each valid record:
        *   A `DailyExpense` model is created with:
            *   `buyer_id`: ID of the found buyer user.
            *   `operation_date`: Set to the current date (`Carbon::now()->toDateString()`) when the form is processed.
            *   `category`: From input.
            *   `quantity`: From input.
            *   `tariff`: From input.
            *   `total`: Calculated as `quantity * tariff`.
            *   `created_by`: ID of the logged-in admin/finance/owner user submitting the form.
            *   `comment`: Automatically set to "Bulk entry via web form".
        *   The creation of a `DailyExpense` triggers the `DailyExpenseObserver`, which automatically creates the corresponding `Transaction` and `TransactionLine` records for the double-entry accounting.
4.  **Logging:**
    *   **Raw Input Log:** Before validation, each raw 4-line input chunk (even invalid ones) is immediately logged as a JSON array to `app/private/logs/bulk_expenses_raw_input.log`.
    *   **Processing Status Log:** After attempting validation and saving, the processing outcome for each record is logged as a single line in JSON format to `app/private/logs/bulk_expenses.log`.
    *   The processing log entry includes:
        *   `submitted_at`: Timestamp of submission.
        *   `submitted_by`: ID of the user who submitted.
        *   `status`: 'success' or 'failed'.
        *   `buyer_username`, `category`, `quantity`, `tariff`: Input values.
        *   `raw_input_ref`: Reference to the original 4-line chunk.
        *   `error`: Error message if processing failed.
5.  **Feedback:**
    *   If all records process successfully, the user is redirected back to the form with a success message indicating the number of records processed.
    *   If any errors occur during validation or saving, the user is redirected back to the form with:
        *   A list of specific errors encountered (including the starting line number and buyer username for context).
        *   The original input data repopulated in the textarea (`old('expense_data')`).

# ACNE INC - Система учета

## Обзор

Система учета для ACNE INC, компании, занимающейся рекламой в социальных сетях. Эта система управляет финансовыми операциями, отслеживает расходы и контролирует балансы для различных пользователей, включая баеров, агентства и финансовый отдел.

## Архитектура системы

Система использует принцип двойной записи в бухгалтерии со следующими основными компонентами:

1. **Управление пользователями**: Обрабатывает различные роли и разрешения
2. **Управление счетами**: Отслеживает балансы для всех субъектов системы
3. **Система транзакций**: Записывает все финансовые операции с записями кредита/дебета
4. **Отчетная панель**: Настраиваемые представления на основе ролей пользователей

## Основные сущности

### Пользователи и роли
- **Владелец (Owner)**: Полный доступ ко всем данным и отчетам. Управляет командами, может приглашать новых пользователей в систему.
- **Финансист (Finance)**: Управляет распределением средств и операционными расходами
- **Баер (Buyer)**: Специалисты по рекламе, использующие аккаунты в социальных сетях. Каждый баер принадлежит к определенной команде.
- **Агентство (Agency)**: Виртуальные пользователи, представляющие контрагентов/поставщиков аккаунтов в социальных сетях

### Типы счетов
- **Системные счета (SYSTEM)**:
  - SYSTEM_ROMA: Основной счет владельца (обычно с отрицательным балансом)
  - SYSTEM_USDT: Операционный счет финансового отдела
  - FINANCE: Счет финансового отдела

- **Счета агентств (AGENCY)**: 
  - Отдельные счета для каждого рекламного агентства (AGENCY_1, AGENCY_2 и т.д.)

## Структура базы данных

### teams (команды)
- uuid
- name (название команды)
- created_at
- updated_at

### users (пользователи)
- uuid
- telegram_id (null для виртуальных пользователей)
- role (роль: owner, finance, buyer, agency)
- name (имя)
- team_id (ссылка на teams, null для не-баеров)
- sub2 (текст, содержит теги баера из внешней системы, например, "tag1,tag2")
- active (активность)
- is_virtual (виртуальный: boolean, true для агентств)
- contact_info (контактная информация для агентств)

### accounts (счета)
- uuid
- user_id (ссылка на пользователя)
- type (тип счета: SYSTEM, AGENCY, CREO, PROXY, ACCOUNTS, OTHER)
- description (описание)
- created_at
- updated_at

> Важно: Баланс счета не хранится в таблице accounts, а вычисляется динамически на основе записей в transaction_lines по формуле: Баланс = Сумма кредитов - Сумма дебетов.

### operations (операции)
- uuid
- date (дата)
- description (описание)
- amount (количество)
- tariff (тариф, опционально)
- total (всего = количество * тариф)
- created_by (создано пользователем, ссылка на users)
- buyer_id (идентификатор баера, опционально)
- comment (комментарий)
- created_at (дата и время создания записи)
- updated_at (дата и время обновления записи)

### transactions (транзакции)
- uuid
- operation_id (идентификатор операции)
- date (дата)
- description (описание)
- status (статус)
- accounting_period (учетный период, к которому относится транзакция, например "2025.01")
- created_at (дата и время создания записи)

### transaction_lines (строки транзакций)
- uuid
- transaction_id (идентификатор транзакции)
- account_id (идентификатор счета)
- debit (дебет)
- credit (кредит)
- description (описание строки транзакции)
- created_at (дата и время создания записи)

## Пример операционной таблицы

Пример структуры операционной таблицы, используемой пользователями:

| Дата             | Имя          | Категория | Количество | Тариф  | Общее   |
|------------------|--------------|-----------|------------|--------|---------|
| 2025.01.01 20:26 | VAS          | 250       | 6,00       | 18,00  | 108,00  |
| 2025.01.01 20:26 | SHYM         | 250       | 6,00       | 18,00  | 108,00  |
| 2025.01.03 18:17 | VAS          | PROXY     | 23,00      | 1,00   | 23,00   |
| 2025.01.03 23:59 | OP GAMBLING  | CREO      | 60,00      | 1,00   | 60,00   |

### Правила доступа к операционной таблице

- **Владелец (Owner)**: Видит и может редактировать все записи
- **Финансист (Finance)**: Видит все записи, может добавлять и редактировать операционные расходы для всех пользователей
- **Баер (Buyer)**: Видит только свои записи, может добавлять информацию о собственных расходах

Записи в операционной таблице служат основанием для создания транзакций в системе двойной записи.

## Типы операционных таблиц

Для удобства работы разных пользователей и разделения функциональности, система использует различные операционные таблицы:

### 1. daily_expenses (Ежедневные расходы)

Таблица для отслеживания ежедневных расходов баеров.

| Дата | Имя | Категория | Количество | Тариф | Общее | Комментарий |
|------|-----|-----------|------------|-------|-------|-------------|
| 2025.01.03 | VAS | PROXY | 23,00 | 1,00 | 23,00 | Покупка прокси |

- **Кто вносит**: Баеры, Финансисты
- **Особенности**: Всегда положительные значения
- **Интерфейс**: Упрощенный для быстрого внесения расходов

### 2. adjustments (Корректировки)

Таблица для корректировок расходов после сверки с агентствами.

| Дата внесения | Имя баера | Категория | Период корректировки | Сумма корректировки | Комментарий |
|---------------|-----------|-----------|---------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| 2025.02.05 | VAS | AGENCY_1 | 2025.01 | -100,00 | Корректировка после сверки с агентством |

- **Кто вносит**: Только Финансисты
- **Особенности**: 
  - Может содержать как положительные, так и отрицательные значения
  - **Важно**: Корректировки относятся к предыдущему месяцу (периоду), а не к дате внесения
  - В отчетах корректировки учитываются в том месяце, к которому они относятся
- **Интерфейс**: Требует указания причины корректировки и выбора периода, к которому она относится

#### Обработка корректировок в системе двойной записи

При создании транзакций на основе записей из таблицы корректировок:

1. В поле `created_at` записывается фактическая дата внесения корректировки
2. В поле `accounting_period` устанавливается период, к которому относится корректировка
3. При формировании отчетов корректировки учитываются в периоде, указанном в `accounting_period`

Это позволяет:
- Сохранить информацию о реальной дате внесения корректировки
- Корректно учесть корректировку в том периоде, к которому она относится
- Формировать точные финансовые отчеты по периодам

#### Учет по периодам в системе

В системе двойной записи поле `accounting_period` размещается только в таблице `transactions`, а не в `transaction_lines` по следующим причинам:

1. **Целостность данных:**
   - Транзакция представляет собой единое атомарное событие
   - Все строки одной транзакции (дебет и кредит) всегда относятся к одному учетному периоду

2. **Оптимизация структуры базы данных:**
   - Предотвращается дублирование данных
   - Исключается риск несогласованности периодов внутри одной транзакции
   - Соблюдаются принципы нормализации данных

3. **Эффективность запросов:**
   - Для формирования отчетов используются SQL запросы с группировкой по `accounting_period`
   - Пример запроса для отчета по расходам за период:
   ```sql
   SELECT 
       t.accounting_period, 
       a.type,
       SUM(tl.debit) as total_expenses
   FROM 
       transactions t
   JOIN 
       transaction_lines tl ON t.uuid = tl.transaction_id
   JOIN 
       accounts a ON tl.account_id = a.uuid
   WHERE 
       t.accounting_period = '2025.01'
   GROUP BY 
       t.accounting_period, a.type;
   ```

Такая организация обеспечивает корректную работу с данными при наличии операций, относящихся к прошлым периодам, и позволяет формировать точные финансовые отчеты.

### 3. fund_transfers (Перемещение средств)

Таблица для отслеживания перемещения средств между счетами.

| Дата | Счет-отправитель | Счет-получатель | Сумма | Комментарий |
|------|------------------|-----------------|-------|-------------|
| 2025.01.01 | SYSTEM_ROMA | AGENCY_1 | 20000,00 | Пополнение счета агентства |

- **Кто вносит**: Владелец, Финансисты
- **Особенности**: Создает транзакции между различными счетами
- **Интерфейс**: Выбор счетов из списка доступных

Все записи из этих таблиц преобразуются в транзакции в системе двойной записи, но разделение на уровне интерфейса позволяет упростить работу пользователей и применять различные правила валидации для разных типов операций.

## Ключевые рабочие процессы

1. **Распределение средств**:
   - Владелец переводит средства агентствам и финансовому отделу
   - Финансовый отдел распределяет средства на операционные расходы

2. **Отслеживание расходов**:
   - Расходы агентства регистрируются по каждому баеру
   - Операционные расходы (прокси, креативы и т.д.) отслеживаются финансовым отделом

3. **Учет доходов**:
   - Доходы получаются из трекера Keitaro путем ежедневных запросов.
   - Результаты сохраняются в отдельной таблице `income_records` со следующей структурой:
     - `id`: Уникальный идентификатор записи
     - `amount`: Сумма дохода
     - `created_at`: Дата и время получения данных
     - `updated_at`: Дата и время обновления записи (если применимо)

4. **Отчетность**:
   - Фильтрация расходов агентств
   - Отслеживание эффективности баеров
   - Мониторинг общего баланса

## Аутентификация

Система использует Telegram для аутентификации и идентификации пользователей.

## Панели управления

В зависимости от ролей пользователей доступны различные панели управления:

1. **Панель владельца**: Общее финансовое состояние, обзор всех счетов
2. **Панель финансиста**: Распределение средств, управление расходами
3. **Панель баера**: Личные расходы и показатели эффективности

# Bulk Daily Expense Entry (API)

This document describes how to use the API endpoint for submitting bulk daily expense records.

## Endpoint

*   **URL:** `/api/v1/bulk-expenses`
*   **Method:** `POST`
*   **Route Name:** `api.v1.bulk-expenses.store`

## Authentication

*   Requires API Key authentication.
*   The API key must be provided in the `Authorization` header as a Bearer token:
    ```
    Authorization: Bearer your_secure_api_key_here
    ```
*   The valid API key is configured in `config/services.php` and sourced from the `INTERNAL_API_KEY` environment variable.
*   Access is controlled by the `auth.internal_api` middleware alias, which points to `App\Http\Middleware\AuthenticateInternalApiKey`.

## Request Body

*   **Content-Type:** `application/json`
*   **Format:** The request body should be a JSON object containing a single key `expense_records`. The value of `expense_records` should be an array of objects, where each object represents one expense record.

*   **Expense Record Object Structure:**
    ```json
    {
      "buyer_username": "petya",
      "category": "creo",
      "quantity": 1,
      "tariff": 44,
      "comment": "Optional comment from API" // Optional field
    }
    ```
    *   `buyer_username` (string, required): Name of an existing user with the `buyer` role.
    *   `category` (string, required): Expense category.
    *   `quantity` (numeric, required): Must be non-negative.
    *   `tariff` (numeric, required): Must be non-negative.
    *   `comment` (string, optional): An optional comment for the expense.

*   **Example Request Body:**
    ```json
    {
      "expense_records": [
        {
          "buyer_username": "petya",
          "category": "creo",
          "quantity": 1,
          "tariff": 44
        },
        {
          "buyer_username": "ivan",
          "category": "farmik",
          "quantity": 10.5,
          "tariff": 2.1,
          "comment": "From Telegram Bot"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

*   **Example `curl` Request:**

    Replace `YOUR_APP_URL` with the actual base URL of your application (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8000`) and `YOUR_API_KEY` with the value of `INTERNAL_API_KEY` from your `.env` file.

    ```bash
    curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/bulk-expenses \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer api_key" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Accept: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "expense_records": [
        {
          "buyer_username": "petya",
          "category": "creo",
          "quantity": 1,
          "tariff": 44
        },
        {
          "buyer_username": "ivan",
          "category": "farmik",
          "quantity": 10.5,
          "tariff": 2.1,
          "comment": "From Telegram Bot"
        }
      ]
    }'
    ```

## Processing

*   The endpoint is handled by the `storeApi` method in `App\Http\Controllers\Admin\BulkExpenseController`.
*   The `expense_records` array is validated.
*   Each record in the array is processed individually:
    *   Input fields (`buyer_username`, `category`, `quantity`, `tariff`, `comment`) are validated (similar rules as web UI: buyer exists, numeric fields are valid).
    *   If valid, a `DailyExpense` record is created:
        *   `buyer_id`: ID of the found buyer user.
        *   `operation_date`: Set to the current date (`Carbon::now()->toDateString()`) when the API request is processed.
        *   `category`: From input.
        *   `quantity`: From input.
        *   `tariff`: From input.
        *   `total`: Calculated as `quantity * tariff`.
        *   `created_by`: Set to the user ID configured in `config('services.internal_api.user_id')` (sourced from `INTERNAL_API_USER_ID` env var).
        *   `comment`: From the optional `comment` field in the input, or null.
    *   Creation triggers the `DailyExpenseObserver` for automatic `Transaction` generation.
*   **Logging:** Similar to the web UI, each attempted record (validation success/failure, db success/failure) is logged as a JSON line to `app/private/logs/bulk_expenses_api.log`. The log entry includes `api_user_id` (from config), status, the input record, and any error message.

## Responses

*   **Success (Status Code: 200 OK):**
    *   Returned if all records in the request were processed successfully.
    *   Body:
        ```json
        {
          "message": "Successfully processed X expense records.",
          "processed_count": X,
          "results": [
            { "status": "success", "input": { ... record 1 ... } },
            { "status": "success", "input": { ... record 2 ... } }
          ]
        }
        ```
*   **Partial Success / Errors (Status Code: 422 Unprocessable Entity):**
    *   Returned if some records failed validation or saving, but others might have succeeded.
    *   Body:
        ```json
        {
          "message": "Processed X records with Y errors.",
          "processed_count": X,
          "error_count": Y,
          "results": [
            { "status": "success", "input": { ... record 1 ... } },
            { "status": "failed", "input": { ... record 2 ... }, "error": "Buyer user 'xyz' not found." },
            { "status": "failed", "input": { ... record 3 ... }, "error": "Quantity must be numeric." }
          ]
        }
        ```
*   **Bad Request (Status Code: 400 Bad Request):**
    *   Returned if the overall request structure is invalid (e.g., missing `expense_records` key, not valid JSON).
    *   Body:
        ```json
        { "message": "Invalid request format. Expected JSON with 'expense_records' array." }
        ```
*   **Unauthorized (Status Code: 401 Unauthorized):**
    *   Returned if the API key is missing, invalid, or not provided correctly.
    *   Body:
        ```json
        { "message": "Unauthorized." }
        ```

VERY IMPORTANT - USING `Laravel 12`

-   Laravel 12, PHP 8.3, MySQL 8 
-   Alpine 
-   Laravel directory is in `acne-accounting` folder
-   Windows 11 Pro development, use Windows PowerShell commands and `;` as separator

## LLM Coding Agent Guidelines for Laravel + PHP (Breeze & Tailwind)

Below are **comprehensive rules**—best practices and "what not to do"—for your LLM-powered coding assistant when scaffolding, developing, or reviewing a Laravel (≥v10) project using PHP, Breeze authentication, and Tailwind CSS. These guidelines embody SOLID, KISS, and DRY principles.

---

## 📐 1. Architectural & Coding Principles

### 1.1 SOLID Principles

1.  **Single Responsibility**
    – One class/module → one responsibility.
2.  **Open/Closed**
    – Classes open for extension, closed for modification (use inheritance/composition).
3.  **Liskov Substitution**
    – Subclasses must be replaceable for their base classes.
4.  **Interface Segregation**
    – Interfaces should be granular; avoid "fat" interfaces.
5.  **Dependency Inversion**
    – Depend on abstractions (interfaces) rather than concretions.

### 1.2 KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)

-   Favour straightforward solutions over over-engineering.
-   Avoid unnecessary patterns, micro-optimizations, or deep inheritance hierarchies.
-   Use Laravel's built-in features (Form Requests, Policies, Resources) before inventing custom abstractions.

### 1.3 DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

-   Extract repeated Blade components, Tailwind class groups (`@apply`), and PHP logic into:
    -   **Blade components** (`<x-alert …/>`)
    -   **View Composers**
    -   **Traits**, **Helper classes**, or **Services**
-   Reuse validation rules via **Form Request** classes.
-   Share configuration values in `config/*.php`.

---

## 🛠️ 2. Laravel-Specific Practices

### 2.1 Project Structure & Conventions

-   **PSR-12** coding standards; enforce via `php-cs-fixer` or `Laravel Pint`.
-   **Naming:**
    -   Controllers → `PascalCaseController` (e.g. `UserController`)
    -   Models → singular (`User`), matching DB `users` table.
    -   Routes → `snake_case`/URL-friendly.
-   **Route Model Binding**
    ```php
    Route::get('/posts/{post}', [PostController::class, 'show']);
    ```
-   **Thin Controllers**
    -   Delegate to Actions or Service classes for business logic.
    -   One action = one public method.

### 2.2 Validation & Security

-   Use **Form Request** classes for input validation/authorization.
-   Always `authorize()` in Form Requests.
-   Escape output in Blade: `{{ $var }}`; only use `{!! !!}` for trusted HTML.
-   Protect against mass assignment: set `$fillable` or `$guarded` on Eloquent models.

### 2.3 Eloquent & Database

-   **Eager-load** relationships to prevent N+1 queries:
    ```php
    Post::with(['author', 'comments'])->paginate();
    ```
-   Use **Query Scopes** for reusable filters.
-   Migrate schema via Laravel migrations; avoid raw SQL when possible.
-   Use **Seeders & Factories** for test data.

### 2.4 APIs & Resources

-   Return **API Resources** for JSON responses:
    ```php
    return new UserResource($user);
    ```
-   Leverage HTTP Response helpers:
    ```php
    return response()->noContent(); // 204
    ```
-   Version API routes (e.g., `/api/v1/...`).

### 2.5 Testing

-   **Feature Tests** for endpoints; **Unit Tests** for individual classes.
-   Use **Factories** (`User::factory()`) and `RefreshDatabase` trait.
-   Aim >80% coverage on critical paths.

---

## 🎨 3. Tailwind CSS & Breeze Frontend

### 3.1 Tailwind Best Practices

-   **Utility-first:** compose small classes for clarity.
-   Extract repeating class sets via `tailwind.config.js` plugins or `@apply` in CSS:
    ```css
    .btn {
        @apply px-4 py-2 rounded-lg bg-blue-600 text-white;
    }
    ```
-   Use variants (`hover:`, `focus:`, `dark:`) for states.
-   Purge unused CSS in production (`NODE_ENV=production npm run build`).

### 3.2 Breeze Scaffolding

-   After `php artisan breeze:install`, organize:
    -   `resources/views/layouts` for base layouts.
    -   Blade components in `resources/views/components`.
-   Customize the Tailwind config (`tailwind.config.js`): add brand colors, spacing scales, etc.

---

## 🚫 4. Bad Practices to Avoid

-   **Fat Controllers & Models**
    – Business logic sprawled across controllers/models.
-   **Inline SQL or DB Queries in Views**
    – Breaks separation; invite performance issues.
-   **Duplicated Validation Rules**
    – Copy-pasting rules across controllers.
-   **Overridden Framework Code**
    – Avoid hacking core; extend via Events, Listeners, or Service Providers.
-   **Global Facade Abuse**
    – Prefer Dependency Injection over static facades when testability is needed.
-   **Neglecting Migrations & Version Control**
    – Hand-editing DB schema outside migrations.
-   **Skipping Cache/Eager-Loading**
