# Fund Transfer API

This document describes how to use the API endpoint for performing single fund transfers between users with automatic agency commission calculation.

## Endpoint

*   **URL:** `/api/v1/transfer`
*   **Method:** `POST`
*   **Route Name:** `api.v1.transfer.store`

## Authentication

*   Requires API Key authentication.
*   The API key must be provided in the `Authorization` header as a Bearer token:
    ```
    Authorization: Bearer your_secure_api_key_here
    ```
*   The valid API key is configured in `config/services.php` and sourced from the `INTERNAL_API_KEY` environment variable.
*   Access is controlled by the `auth.internal_api` middleware alias, which points to `App\Http\Middleware\AuthenticateInternalApiKey`.

## Request Body

*   **Content-Type:** `application/json`
*   **Format:** The request body should be a JSON object containing transfer details.

*   **Transfer Request Object Structure:**
    ```json
    {
      "from_user": "agent 007",
      "to_user": "petya",
      "amount": 100.00,
      "description": "Payment for services"
    }
    ```
    *   `from_user` (string, required): Username of the sender. Must be an existing active user.
    *   `to_user` (string, required): Username of the recipient. Must be an existing active user and different from `from_user`.
    *   `amount` (numeric, required): Transfer amount. Must be greater than 0.01.
    *   `description` (string, optional): Optional description for the transfer. Defaults to "API Transfer" if not provided.

*   **Example `curl` Request:**

    Replace `YOUR_APP_URL` with the actual base URL of your application (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8000`) and `YOUR_API_KEY` with the value of `INTERNAL_API_KEY` from your `.env` file.

    ```bash
    curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/transfer \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key_here" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Accept: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "from_user": "agent 007",
      "to_user": "petya",
      "amount": 100.00,
      "description": "Commission transfer"
    }'
    ```

## Commission Logic

The API automatically applies agency commission when transferring FROM agency users:

*   **Agency Users**: Users with `role = 'agency'` and `terms > 0`
*   **Commission Calculation**: `final_amount = original_amount + (original_amount Ã— commission_rate)`
*   **Example**: Transfer $100 from agency with 7.77% commission = $107.77 final amount

### Available Test Users

Based on the current system configuration:

**Agency Users (with automatic commission):**
*   `"agent 007"` - 7.77% commission rate
*   `"agent 001"` - 1.11% commission rate  
*   `"agent 0013"` - 2.5% commission rate

**Buyer Users (no commission):**
*   `"petya"`
*   `"ivan"`
*   `"ivan2"`

**System Users:**
*   `"System"` - for system transfers
*   `"admin"` - owner account

## Processing

*   The endpoint is handled by the `singleTransferApi` method in `App\Http\Controllers\Admin\FundTransferController`.
*   Request validation ensures users exist and are different.
*   Processing steps:
    1. **User Resolution**: Find users by username and verify they are active
    2. **Account Selection**: Automatically find appropriate USD accounts for both users (prioritizes `*_MAIN` accounts)
    3. **Commission Calculation**: If sender is agency with terms > 0, automatically add commission
    4. **Fund Transfer Creation**: Create record in `fund_transfers` table
    5. **Transaction Recording**: Use `TransactionService` to create double-entry accounting records
    6. **Logging**: Comprehensive logging throughout the process

*   **Account Selection Logic**:
    *   Automatically finds USD accounts for both users
    *   Prioritizes accounts with `*_MAIN` suffix (BUYER_MAIN, AGENCY_MAIN, etc.)
    *   Throws error if no suitable USD account found for either user

*   **Database Records Created**:
    *   `fund_transfers`: Records transfer details including final amount and commission info
    *   `transactions`: Main transaction record with description and accounting period
    *   `transaction_lines`: Double-entry debit/credit lines for proper accounting

## Responses

    *   Returned when transfer is completed successfully.

        ```json

## Integration Notes

*   This API endpoint can be used by external systems (like Telegram bots) to automate fund transfers
*   All transfers are logged comprehensively for audit purposes
*   The endpoint maintains the same business logic as the web interface
*   Commission calculation is automatic and cannot be disabled via API (maintains business rule consistency)
*   Only USD transfers are currently supported
*   The API defaults to using the admin user (ID: 1) for `created_by` if no authentication context is available
